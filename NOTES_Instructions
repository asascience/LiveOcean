Patrick,

Thanks for the phone call yesterday.  So, to get things going, I have added you as a collaborator on the LO_ROMS repo in https://github.com/parkermac.  This is our modified version of ROMS.  Please do not distribute this version of the code.

You can find the makefiles by cloning https://github.com/parkermac/makefiles and what you need to compile is in lo6biom.

David can set you up with an account on boiler.  Then the files required to run a single three day forecast are in a folder like:
/data1/parker/LiveOcean_output/cas6_v3/f2019.11.06

The other thing you would need would be the grid file, in: /fjdata1/parker/LiveOcean_data/grids/cas6

as well as hour 24 of the previous day's forecast for an initial condition:
/data1/parker/LiveOcean_roms/output/cas6_v3_lo8b/f2019.11.05/ocean_his_0025.nc

you will also need two .in files which are liveocean.in and npzd2o_Banas.in in npzd2o_Banas in /data1/parker/LiveOcean_roms/output/cas6_v3_lo8b/f2019.11.06
note that a lot of directory paths are hard-wired in these files.

The driver script is is driver_roms_mox.sh in /data1/parker/LiveOcean/driver (note that you can get the full LiveOcean repo, including this driver, from my GitHub).

Lastly, you should start by reading this:
http://faculty.washington.edu/pmacc/LO/architecture.html
which describes the general LiveOcean code organization.  This may be a bit out of date, but not much.  I'll try to look over it soon.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Cheers,

Parker
