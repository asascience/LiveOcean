Tiffany,

Here is your to-go order. It will take a pro like Patrick Tripp to do this, I expect.

From my github repo https://github.com/parkermac clone LO, LO_roms_user, and LO_roms_source_alt. They each have README's which should be helpful, although they are specific to people working in my ecosystem of machines.

Using svn (directions in the README for LO_roms_user) get the ROMS source code into LO_roms_source

Compile x2b in LO_roms_user

Get forcing for one day from my machine apogee in /dat1/parker/LO_output/forcing/cas6/f2017.06.01 (once we know who is doing this we can set them up with an account).

Modify LO/driver/driver_roms_3.py to work in your environment (this is really the only thing you need LO for - no need to go through all the LO/README installation steps)

Get ROMS output from apogee from the previous day /dat1/parker/LO_roms/cas6_traps2_x2b/f2017.05.31, at least ocean_rst.nc.

Then see if you can run one day (2017.06.01), using "perfect" start type and compare to my run for that day.

I expect many questions,
Parker

Patrick's Notes:

It took about 10-15 to tgz the data and another 12 minutes do download
the output, and :22 to download the forcing.

From Paker:

python3 driver_roms3.py -g cas6 -t traps2 -x x2b -0 2017.06.01-1
2017.06.01 -np 200 -N 40 -s perfect < /dev/null > patrick.log &

The np means you are telling it to use 200 cores, and N tells it there
are 40 cores on a node. These are used when the driver calls a python
program that fills in some fields in the klone_batch.sh file. Setting s
to perfect means it uses perfect restart (need to have compiled ROMS
with that cpp flag), and there should be an ocean_rst.nc file in the
f2017.05.31 folder you have.
